			Andrew DeMaria is a senior at Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado
			studying Computer Science. He spent 3 years teaching Cub Scouts at Peaceful
			Valley Ranch as a lifeguard. Afterwards, he was an intern for Lockheed Martin
			under their classified Military Support Program (MSP) where he worked on
			implementing a full Kerberos and LDAP based Authentication and Authorization
			system. There began his interest in information security and he has continued
			diving into the topic since.

			In his spare time, Andrew enjoys the Colorado Wilderness with backpacking,
			climbing, mountaineering, skiing and photography. When the weather does not
			cooperate he likes to hack on a Raspberry Pi.

	\framesubtitle{TCP's Handshake process}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol underlying
			most internet communications today.  It uses a 3 step handshake to
			establish a connection
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Client will send a $SYN$ to a listening server.  The sequence
					number($seq\_num$) is set to a random number.
				\item Server responds with $SYN$-$ACK$, with the acknowledgement number
					($ack\_num$) set to 1 plus the $seq\_num$.  It sets a new random value
					for $seq\_num$
				\item Client responds with an $ACK$.
					\begin{itemize}
						\item $ack\_num = 1 + seq\_num$
						\item $seq\_num = 1 + ack\_num$
					\end{itemize}
			\end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

	\only<1>{
	\framesubtitle{The flaw in TCP}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The TCP handshake process requires the server to save
			state before the connection can be established
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Sequence and Acknowledgement numbers need to be saved
				\item State is saved in a Transmission Control Block (TCB)
			\end{itemize}
		\item There is a limited amount of room that the operating system saves for
			TCBs 
	\end{itemize}
}
\only<2>{
	\framesubtitle{Attack Steps}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The attacker sends a $SYN$ packet
		\item The victim sends back a $SYN$-$ACK$
			% The attacker may also spoof the ip address so that his machine does not
			% respond and close the connection
		\item The attacker sends... {\em nothing}
		\item This leaves a half open TCP connection on the server, consuming
			resources
		\item Attacker repeats Step 1 many times
			\begin{itemize}
				\item TCP connections are only flushed out after a period of time, or in
					some implementations, when the TCB pool is depleted
			\end{itemize}
		\item With so many open connections on the server, new legitimate traffic
			cannot get through
	\end{enumerate}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item SYN Caching
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Instead of creating an entire TCB, use a table for half-open
					connections
			\end{itemize}
		\item SYN Cookies
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Lazily creates TCBs so that half open connections don't require
					resources %TODO
			\end{itemize}
		\item Application Firewalls / Proxy
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Lets an external system do all the TCP connection management and
					forwards completed connections along

		\framesubtitle{What is DNS?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item DNS (Domain Name System) provides a mapping of names to IP addresses
				%That way we can keep down on the number of mysql ip addresses we have to
				%memorize :)
			%\begin{verbatim}
			\begin{semiverbatim}
			www.google.com -> 74.125.227.112
			\end{semiverbatim}
			%\end{verbatim}
			\item DNS has a hierarchal structure with authoritative nodes
				%\begin{verbatim} TODO
				%.
				%edu, com, gov, ...
				%mines      google   credera
				%\end{verbatim}
			\item Nodes can have several different types of records
				%for which they are authoritative
				\begin{itemize}
					\item {\ttfamily A} % The typical ip record
					\item {\ttfamily CNAME}
						% For any aliases that also map to the A record.
					\item {\ttfamily AAAA} 
						% ip 6
					\item {\ttfamily TXT}	\dots
				\end{itemize}

	\only<2>{
		\framesubtitle{How do you use it?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Clients / Resolvers interact with DNS servers with Queries

				\end{lstlisting}
				% TODO find a home for this
			%\item Authoritative responses are from the original DNS 
			%\item Caching may be employed at which point the authoritative bit will not
				%be set.
				%\begin{itemize}
					%\item DNS caches are usually set up by the ISP
						%%This reduces a lot of stress so that each person does not have to do a
						%%iterative lookup
				%\end{itemize}
			\item Queries use UDP %\em{important}
				%Important for the response aspect of the DNS reflection attack... fire and
				%forget

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{DNS Reflection Attacks... Theory}
	\framesubtitle{The Theory behind the Attack}
	The idea behind a DNS reflection attack is to make large DNS requests on
	behalf of your victim
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The attacker sends queries, spoofing the victim's IP, to many
			different DNS servers
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Remember.. this is UDP
			\end{itemize}
			% As compared to TCP where a handshake would be involved
		\item DNS server responses are sent to the victim
		\item Attack generates so much traffic that the hardware can't even keep up
			%10 Gpbs up is saturated by a 11 Gpbs down
	\end{enumerate}
	However... None of this is possible without open DNS resolvers...
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
	\frametitle{DNS Reflection Attacks... Open Resolvers}
	\only<1>{
		\framesubtitle{What are Open Resolvers?}
		Open Resolvers are misconfigured DNS servers that will respond to recursive
		requests for domains they are not authoritative for.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item To be authoritative, the domain must be in that DNS
				server's zone
			\item Normally DNS queries use an iterative approach
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Resolving www.google.com starts at root, then com, google, and
						so on
					\item Instead of pointing a query to the next domain, an open resolver
						makes the recursive requests
				\end{itemize}
			%\item  It is okay for DNS servers to be recursive.  The caching servers setup by
				%your ISP are recursive, but only for requests coming from their zone. 
			%\item The problem lies when anyone can make a query to an open resolver
		\end{itemize}

		\framesubtitle{So how bad is it?}
		There are a little over 28 {\em million} open resolvers operating
		today\footnote{ As reported by http://openresolverproject.org/breakdown.cgi on
		2013-08-11}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is pretty trivial for attackers to find them
			\item Most businesses / organizations don't even realize that they are
				contributing to the demise of the internet

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{DNS Reflection Attacks... Increasing the effectiveness}
	\framesubtitle{DNS Reflection attacks can be further amplified }
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Botnets allow for additional throughput on the attackers size,
			linearly scaling the attack
		\item Extensions to DNS allow for increase response size
			\begin{itemize}
				\item EDNS 0 allows for DNS packets to go beyond the initial 512 byte
					limit up to 4096 bytes
				\item DNSSEC adds fields for keys and signatures for validating DNS
					records
			\end{itemize}
		\item Attackers may also compromise a DNS server to publish their own
			records

		\item Instead of sending full packets for the POST data, it sends the data a

		\item The webserver's connection pool becomes used up as all the threads are
			waiting on incoming POST data
